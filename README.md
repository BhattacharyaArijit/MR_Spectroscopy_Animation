## MRS Visual Animations (Python)

This repository contains simple Python animations for understanding teaching core MR Spectroscopy (MRS) signal generation, PRESS voxel selection, visualization of FID to frequency, estimation of concentration in both time and frequency domain, basis fitting of MRS concepts.
The scripts generate presentation-ready GIFs that visually explain how spectroscopy signals form in time and space.
These are conceptual teaching tools, not full physics simulators.
